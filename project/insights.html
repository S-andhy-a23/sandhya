            <h2>Love Flooding</h2>
            <p>Also known as "love bombing," people who flood you with love will shower you in care, appreciation, and affection to butter you up for a request. People who love flood aren’t in the habit of showing you genuine care—they’re only nice to you when they want something, which can be very draining and painful.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Love Withholding</h2>
            <p>Someone using dark psychology may also be prone to love withholding. This is sort of the opposite of love flooding—they’ll deny you any care or affection until you do what they want.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Choice Restriction </h2>
            <p> Someone with a dark triad personality may use choice restriction to warp your sense of freedom or choose to do something they want (not what you want). This can distract you from making the right choice, or make you think you’ve got a fewer number of choices than you actually do </p>

            <h2>Reverse Psychology </h2>
            <p>You don’t want to read this. Seriously, read no further. Did we get you? If you are still reading this, you’ve just been tricked by reverse psychology. By coyly acting like you don’t want something to happen, you can make it come true—but only if you’ve got the chops to put on a convincing show </p>
