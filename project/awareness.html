            <h2>Love Flooding</h2>
            <p>Dismiss any requests with kindness, but do it quickly and move on. If they stop being nice to you, you know they’re love bombing you.</p>

            <h2>Love Withholding</h2>
            <p>Don’t take the cold shoulder personally. Do your best to ignore any love withholding. They obviously need you more than you need them.</p>

            <h2>Choice Restriction</h2>
            <p>Don’t accept the false options presented to you. The world is rarely so straightforward that there are only 2-3 options, so if someone tells you you’re backed into choosing something, reject the premise.</p>
