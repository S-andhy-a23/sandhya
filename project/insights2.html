            <h2>Lying</h2>
            <p>This one isn’t particularly unique to people with a dark triad personality, but they’ll rely on lies all the same. They might lie about small things to make themselves sound more important or cool than they really are, or lie about bigger things to try and cover their major indiscretions.</p>

        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Gaslighting</h2>
            <p>Gaslighting refers to a form of manipulation where a person tries to convince someone that they’re going crazy, or that their memory is failing them to get them to believe something beneficial for the gaslighter. It’s insidious because gaslighting can be harder and harder to catch once it starts, and it can have serious ramifications if you fall for it.</p>

        <div class="insight">
            <h2>Semantic Manipulation</h2>
            <p>This is a fancy phrase for “word games.” Basically, if someone is twisting your words (or their words) to make it sound like something else was actually said, they’re manipulating semantics. This can be nefarious if someone tries to hold you to a promise you never made, or trick you into thinking you said something you never meant. </p>

            <h2>Confidence Breaching</h2>
            <p>People with a dark triad personality will have no problem revealing your personal secrets if it benefits them. Your secrets will never be safe with someone with a dark psychology, so don’t share anything important with them after the first time it happens</p>
